              <p class="text-start">
                I’d like to start this post by saying that my girlfriend, dog, and I are doing just fine. My dog and I have been making the most out of the quarantine and are really enjoying each other’s unlimited company (I think he’s in it mostly for the unlimited snacks). My girlfriend works at a local hospital, and while that definitely adds to the stress levels, I have trust in her ability as a healthcare provider.
              </p>
              <p class="text-start">
                It’s been wild to watch this whole thing unfold. I’m 30 years old, and I’ve lived through my fair share of apocalypses, but this was especially intense. Every zombie movie/show/game I had ever watched/played seemed like it had come to life. Except, this is reality, and people are actually dying. And there’s absolutely no one having fun.
              </p>
              <p class="text-start">
                The situation became substantive to me one day in early March when I went to the grocery store and everyone was speed walking down the aisles and there wasn’t a single piece of animal protein on the shelf. I remember thinking: <em>If one person starts to jog or run, this whole thing is gonna turn into a riot.</em>
              </p>
              <p class="text-start">
                Thank God that’s not really the atmosphere at grocery stores anymore, but now I have to deal with the facemasks making everything feel like a dystopian cyberpunk noir film.
              </p>
              <p class="text-start">
                I started working from home in mid-March and there isn’t even discussion about when we might head back to the office. I settled into working from my dining table way easier than I thought I would. Just like everyone else, we’re struggling to find a <span class="bg-dark text-dark">#############</span>. We’ve settled on a <span class="bg-dark text-dark">r------------------------------n</span>, but it has to be <span class="bg-dark text-dark">s----------------------n</span> Service Desk personnel using a <span class="bg-dark text-dark">G----------t</span> to stay organized. The entire setup is <span class="bg-dark text-dark">b--------------------y</span> nothing more than our <span class="bg-dark text-dark">s------------------s</span>. But here we are, <span class="bg-dark text-dark">t----------------------------------------------------------s</span> from our apartments. <a href="#note"><span class="badge badge-warning">See Note</span></a>
              </p>
              <p class="text-start">
                This is not me complaining. I’m one of the lucky Americans who get to remain employed full-time <em>and</em> maintain quarantine. I just find it immensely interesting to see that Life truly does just go on.
              </p>
              <p class="text-start">
                My girlfriend’s nursing school coursework has moved completely online, and she’s had to rely solely on my five-year-old MacBook Pro do get everything done. This wouldn’t be an issue for anyone else, as these machines are designed to work great for their lifetime, but I’m not a regular computer owner.
              </p>
              <p class="text-start">
                This computer was the first Unix-like machine I had ever owned that was capable of doing real-life computer things. In 2015, I used this thing to start a game streaming channel on Twitch complete with the ridiculous microphone wiring harness needed to record audio from an Xbox One. I installed several virtual microphones to screencap me playing Steam games. I changed the shell, installed Homebrew and dabbled in Jenkins from GitHub, and about a million other stupid things that I don’t know how to uninstall. It’s gotten to the point where I have to check the memory usage and start deleting emails off the Apple email client in an attempt to reclaim some storage space.
              </p>
              <p class="text-start">
                Years of random Python programs, hacking practice, VMs, and using this thing as a DLNA server have really taken their toll. When my girlfriend needed to take a proctored exam, the web-app she was instructed to use returned so many security errors that it wouldn’t even let her login to the system. Long-story short, don’t use <a href="https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/14067/soundflower" target="_blank">Soundflower</a>. It’s not that good and apparently, it’s a big security hole (If you’re wondering how to uninstall it, you have to delete the .kext file).
              </p>
              <p class="text-start">
                The silver lining to all of this is that I’m actually saving money. I’ve funded my savings account, paid off a credit card, and boosted my credit score into the 700s. *virtual shrug*
              </p>
              <p class="text-start">
                I don’t know when this is going to end. I don’t know when I’m going back to work in an office, and I still don’t know how I feel about working from home. The days have been flying by and its depressing sometimes, and great other times. Either way, I’m grateful that my situation has allowed me to be philosophically existential, when so many others have their actual existence on the line.
              </p>
              <p class="text-start"><span class="badge badge-warning text-start" id="note">Note</span><blockquote class="text-start alert alert-warning">
                The original text of this paragraph contained language that was too specific to my day-to-day job functions. Instead of just deleting the text, I decided to use the cool <samp class="badge badge-secondary">REDACTED</samp> formatting.

                The new year has brought in several new changes that have been unexpected, surprisingly convenient, and altogether annoying. Seeing as Time is a construct, I’ve just been considering these events “business as usual” in the nascent career of an IT pro.
              </p>
  
              <p class="text-start">
                Two days before the end of 2019, my company, Omnitec Solutions Inc., was purchased and fully incorporated into Gryphon Technologies. The gritty details of the acquisition aren’t actually relevant to my position as a Service Desk Analyst, but they have been keeping me busy with mundane HR tasks like re-learning timesheet submissions, and re-enrolling in benefits.
              </p>
  
              <p class="text-start">
                It’s also given me the opportunity to update a usually static area of my site– my Work History. I’ve made the decision to just update the name of the company and leave out any reference to the former entity. My résumé has also been updated, and the new version is reflected in the link at the top of all my site pages.
              </p>
  
              <p class="text-start">
                My site itself is also receiving a few upgrades:
                <ul class="text-start">
                  <li>Update to Bootstrap 4.4.1</li>
                  <li>Site traffic is now monitored by Google Analytics</li>
                  <li>Repurposed Home page to showcase a single blog post</li>
                  <li>Now using pagination to archive older posts</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
  
              <p class="text-start">
                I’m also considering moving the maintenance of this site to a dedicated Raspberry Pi desktop in order to have more coding elbow room. It’s getting a little cumbersome running absolutely everything out of my five-year-old laptop.

                I currently hold the CompTIA Security+ certification. It’s a general, beginner level cert that shows prospective employers that I have a strong understanding of the basics of cybersecurity. While this is a great starting point for security-minded networking folks, there is so much more to the Security field than what this one cert covers.
              </p>
  
              <p class="text-start">
                Since I work in the Public Sector, I’m beholden to the <a href="https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodm/857001m.pdf" target="_blank">DoD 8750.01-m</a> directive. It’s a big, scary, official-sounding name for what is essentially just a set of rules dictating who can have which job. There are tons of certs that satisfy these requirements at different levels, and Security+ is right at the bottom for the newbies.
              </p>
  
              <p class="text-start">
                This is why I’m now studying for the <a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications/cybersecurity-analyst" target="_blank">CompTIA CySA+</a> exam. It would be like ‘leveling myself up’ in the game of professional skills. So many more IA levels will be available to me once I have this cert next to my name. It’ll also be one step closer to the coveted <a href="https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP#" target="_blank">CISSP</a> certification. This one is the granddaddy of them all. In fact, it’s the only cert mentioned in the directive <em>by name</em>.
              </p>
  
              <p class="text-start">
                There is so much I have to teach myself before attempting this exam. I have to be an expert in core networking functionality and be able to spot problems a mile away. I also have to learn how to think like a cybercriminal. Proactively guarding against threats is the main way modern systems keep their heads above water.

                I tend to not take social media too seriously. As a result, my pages don’t really reflect some of my more interesting personal hobbies, such as filmmaking. I saw this as an opportunity to showcase some of my less technical, spur-of-the moment projects. These are pretty rare and will usually sit and age until I can spare a few minutes out of the day to edit.

                Here is a video I shot on an iPhone X and edited with DaVinci.

                It’s not a masterpiece, or even really a “vlog”, but it includes everything I like about the filming process. Shooting it was fun, and even though I shouldn’t have been driving while using my phone like this, I think the “hand-held” look is great. I made sure to set my fps to 24 to give it a cinematic feel.
              </p>
  
              <p class="text-start">
                Editing was interesting because it forced me to turn the mundane task of going to Buc-ee’s for pecans into something quirky and entertaining. The quick edits captured the important action and the faux sepia overlay gave the clip a non-serious, dreamy attitude.

              <p class="text-start">
                Overall, this is pretty indicative of what I like to produce on my free time, and even though they’re few and far between, they’re a fun creative outlet for someone with no actual creativity.
