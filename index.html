            <p class="text-left">
              I’d like to start this post by saying that my girlfriend, dog, and I are doing just fine. My dog and I have been making the most out of the quarantine and are really enjoying each other’s unlimited company (I think he’s in it mostly for the unlimited snacks). My girlfriend works at a local hospital, and while that definitely adds to the stress levels, I have trust in her ability as a healthcare provider.
            </p>
            <p class="text-left">
              It’s been wild to watch this whole thing unfold. I’m 30 years old, and I’ve lived through my fair share of apocalypses, but this was especially intense. Every zombie movie/show/game I had ever watched/played seemed like it had come to life. Except, this is reality, and people are actually dying. And there’s absolutely no one having fun.
            </p>
            <p class="text-left">
              The situation became substantive to me one day in early March when I went to the grocery store and everyone was speed walking down the aisles and there wasn’t a single piece of animal protein on the shelf. I remember thinking: <em>If one person starts to jog or run, this whole thing is gonna turn into a riot.</em>
            </p>
            <p class="text-left">
              Thank God that’s not really the atmosphere at grocery stores anymore, but now I have to deal with the facemasks making everything feel like a dystopian cyberpunk noir film.
            </p>
            <p class="text-left">
              I started working from home in mid-March and there isn’t even discussion about when we might head back to the office. I settled into working from my dining table way easier than I thought I would. Just like everyone else, we’re struggling to find a <span class="bg-dark text-dark">#############</span>. We’ve settled on a <span class="bg-dark text-dark">r------------------------------n</span>, but it has to be <span class="bg-dark text-dark">s----------------------n</span> Service Desk personnel using a <span class="bg-dark text-dark">G----------t</span> to stay organized. The entire setup is <span class="bg-dark text-dark">b--------------------y</span> nothing more than our <span class="bg-dark text-dark">s------------------s</span>. But here we are, <span class="bg-dark text-dark">t----------------------------------------------------------s</span> from our apartments. <a href="#note"><span class="badge badge-warning">See Note</span></a>

              This is not me complaining. I’m one of the lucky Americans who get to remain employed full-time <em>and</em> maintain quarantine. I just find it immensely interesting to see that Life truly does just go on.
            </p>
            <p class="text-left">
              My girlfriend’s nursing school coursework has moved completely online, and she’s had to rely solely on my five-year-old MacBook Pro do get everything done. This wouldn’t be an issue for anyone else, as these machines are designed to work great for their lifetime, but I’m not a regular computer owner.
            </p>
            <p class="text-left">
              This computer was the first Unix-like machine I had ever owned that was capable of doing real-life computer things. In 2015, I used this thing to start a game streaming channel on Twitch complete with the ridiculous microphone wiring harness needed to record audio from an Xbox One. I installed several virtual microphones to screencap me playing Steam games. I changed the shell, installed Homebrew and dabbled in Jenkins from GitHub, and about a million other stupid things that I don’t know how to uninstall. It’s gotten to the point where I have to check the memory usage and start deleting emails off the Apple email client in an attempt to reclaim some storage space.
            </p>
            <p class="text-left">
              Years of random Python programs, hacking practice, VMs, and using this thing as a DLNA server have really taken their toll. When my girlfriend needed to take a proctored exam, the web-app she was instructed to use returned so many security errors that it wouldn’t even let her login to the system. Long-story short, don’t use <a href="https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/14067/soundflower" target="_blank">Soundflower</a>. It’s not that good and apparently, it’s a big security hole (If you’re wondering how to uninstall it, you have to delete the .kext file).
            </p>
            <p class="text-left">
              The silver lining to all of this is that I’m actually saving money. I’ve funded my savings account, paid off a credit card, and boosted my credit score into the 700s. *virtual shrug*
            </p>
            <p class="text-left">
              I don’t know when this is going to end. I don’t know when I’m going back to work in an office, and I still don’t know how I feel about working from home. The days have been flying by and its depressing sometimes, and great other times. Either way, I’m grateful that my situation has allowed me to be philosophically existential, when so many others have their actual existence on the line.
            </p>

              The origianl text of this paragraph contained language that was too specific to my day-to-day job functions. Instead of just deleting the text, I decided to use the cool <samp class="badge badge-secondary">REDACTED</samp> formatting.
