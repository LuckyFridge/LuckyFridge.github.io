          <h6 class="text-start post-start"><em><strong>New Cert</strong></em><br>by Rudy Portillo<br>27/Jun/21</h6><br>

          <p class="text-start ">
            Getting the A+ cert brings me two-thirds of the way to the CompTIA “trifecta”. It’s a bit of a cringe term, but at least industry folks know what I’m talking about when it stumbles out of my mouth during a Google Meet. I believe it’s CompTIA’s second-most “beginner” level cert, but my journey achieving it was absolutely harrowing… or at least <em>half</em> of it was. 
          </p>

          <p class="text-start">
            I’d never intended to earn the A+ cert as I didn’t see its applicability to the cybersecurity field. Apparently, it’s VERY applicable, and with the new prevalence of side-channel attacks, it’s a good thing to have a solid foundation in computer hardware. It was a foundation I was sure I already possessed and was extremely cocky going into the official course and exam. The borderline arrogance was justified when I blew through the course and absolutely slam dunked the Core 1 portion of the exam. Hundreds of hours spent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/LinusTechTips/featured" target="_blank">watching LTT computer building tutorials</a> had finally paid off. 
          </p>

          <p class="text-start">
            When Core 2 rolled around, I tried riding that wave of confidence as far as it would take me...which was not very far at all. The second part of the cert was all dense troubleshooting how-to guides, “computer safety” processes, and “professionalism” tips and tricks. I tried speedrunning it like I did the first section and all it produced was frustration and self-pity. I made the terrible decision to Hail Mary the exam and opted to take the at-home version. This was the most egregious mistake in a long line of epic blunders. 
          </p>

          <p class="text-start">
            I was doing some light reviewing before my scheduled exam and about one hour before I had to login to PearsonVue, my home network had a Hindenburg-level meltdown. I scrambled to find any trickle of internet connection I could find. I eventually had to hardwire my laptop directly to my modem, bypassing my switch and router. When I finally logged on to the exam site, I had 3 mins to go through their maze of an onboarding process. To add to the pile, I tried to authenticate using a temporary state ID via a picture taken with my phone. When I finally got that mess untangled and was set to begin, the proctor couldn’t access my webcam and made me redo the entire onboarding process. I began the exam one and a half hours after my scheduled appointment. 
          </p>

          <p class="text-start">
            I failed. 
          </p>

          <p class="text-start">
            After settling my ID issues with a random county north of my city, and scheduling a second exam, I crammed for 5 days straight and took the test at an official testing center. I passed by the skin of my teeth on the second go around. Six measly points over the minimum score. I’d never been so happy. 
          </p>

          <p class="text-start">
            I celebrated by <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/luckyfridge" target="_blank">streaming</a> an equally poor performance on Warzone. 
          </p>

          <p class="text-start">
            Now that the dust has settled, I’m certified and eligible to move on to my next semester. The next class is Network+ so hopefully I’ve learned my lesson on how NOT to study for CompTIA exams. I doubt it though. 
          </p>

          <p class="text-start">
            As far as my site goes, I’ve made several minor updates:
            <ul class="text-start">
              <li>Mild <span class="font-monospace">&lt;hr&gt;</span> formatting</li>
              <li>Updating the mailing address on my resume</li>
              <li>Adding a fourth page to house my posts as they age</li>
              <li>Upgrading the backend styling to <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/" target="_blank">Bootstrap 5</a></li>
              <li>And of course updating the <a href="certs" target="_blank">Certs</a> page</li>
              <li>I even updated the Copyright year in the footer of all the pages</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p class="text-start">
            I plan on making at least one more post before I complain about the Network+ exam. It’ll most likely deal with life post-Covid and how it’s affected my job and nearly everything else about the world. I may even talk about the various apocalypses Texas has managed to survive in the first 6 months of the year. 
          </p>

          <p class="text-start">
            All things considered, life is looking good and I’m pretty optimistic in general. I’m even working on a non-professional site at <a href="https://www.luckyfridge.com" target="_blank">luckyfridge.com</a>. The plan is to have it be centered around my gaming and streaming hobbies. 
          </p>

          <p class="text-start">
            So stay tuned. Cool things coming. 
          </p>
