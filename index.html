            <h6 class="text-left post-start"><em><strong>CoV-2</strong></em><br>by Rudy Portillo<br>24/Jul/2020</h6><br>

            <p class="text-left">
               It’s been three months since my last update, and to be honest, morale hasn’t improved. I ended my last post with a pseudo-hopeful platitude about being grateful despite all that was going on in the world; and while that hasn’t changed, I can’t ignore the bleakness of our future. In a mere 90 days, things went from bad to worse. A thick fog of misinformation has settled over everything and thinking critically about our situation is turning into a full-time job in and of itself. The most upsetting part of all this is that the most predictable thing has happened: People have turned on each other. Whether this is out of fear or ignorance, I don’t know. There now may not be a distinction between the two.

              I guess the most obvious example to point out would be the sheer amount of conspiracy theories cropping up on social media. Some claims are simply rehashed versions of the old “blame the government” trope and are generally harmless. But others are so absurd and comical that you can’t help but think the ones pushing these ideas are in on the joke. My favorite theory in this category is the “5G causes COVID-19” claim. The mental gymnastics required to link cell towers to a novel virus are impressive to say the least. I like seeing weirdos post maps of 5G towers overlaid with coronavirus hotspot maps to present the similarity as rock-solid proof of their ideas. It’s even more fun to see their bubbles burst when other people point out that those maps also correlate to population density, which of course explains why the other two maps look almost the same. But people don’t like to be wrong, and the conversation inevitably devolves into a depressing tirade of insults.

              Less amusing though, is the disagreement over face coverings. I still cannot believe that this concept became politicized. I can’t understand the mind of someone who would hear the logical advice of “cover your face so your spit doesn’t get everywhere” and think, <em>No, you can’t make me do that</em>. From what I can tell, there are as many reasons why people won’t mask up as there are anti-maskers themselves. The most annoying people are those who cite their Constitutional freedoms as a free pass for not having to use a mask. 1) The virus does not discriminate based on nationality. 2) The virus does not affect people differently based on their level of patriotism. 3) Your Constitutional rights essentially end where mine begin. WEARING A MASK KEEPS OTHERS SAFE! After doing some research, the consensus since May of this year is that: at worst, simple homemade masks only block a certain percentage of aerosols of a certain size or bigger. At best, they block spit droplets at a high enough rate that there are numerous examples of the virus <em>not</em> spreading even in non-socially distanced situations. I’ve included a quote from May regarding the effectiveness of face coverings.

              Mandating face mask use in public is associated with a decline in the daily COVID-19 growth rate by 0.9, 1.1, 1.4, 1.7, and 2.0 percentage-points in 1–5, 6–10, 11–15, 16–20, and 21+ days after signing, respectively. Estimates suggest as many as 230,000–450,000 COVID-19 cases possibly averted By May 22, 2020 by these mandates.<br>

              It’s important to note that hindering the virus’ spread is a three-pronged approach involving masks, hand washing, and social distancing. But for whatever reason, face coverings became the flashpoint, which is why I highlighted their effectiveness.
            </p>

            <p class="text-left">
              The more sinister side of this mask denial is that some people are intellectually dishonest about the situation, and will downplay the severity of the virus, in general, to support their views. Personally, I find that morally reprehensible. They’ll claim mortality percentages prove that the whole thing is “overblown” and that everyone is going to “catch it eventually”. Because of their self-centeredness, they refuse to understand that even a small percentage of 300,000,000 people is a large number. And it’s a number that represents actual humans dying, and there’s an even larger number of them actively suffering.
            </p>

            <p class="text-left">
              At the very least, these anti-mask crusaders acknowledge the existence of the virus as a fact. Some people think even that is going too far and won’t accept that there’s anything to be concerned about in the first place. For me, this is where the conspiracy theories regain some of their lightheartedness. Simply because I view these people as ‘unreachable’ by common sense or logic. A good time-waster is to search YouTube with the term “COVID Karen”. You’ll be served with results dealing with anti-maskers like the ones mentioned earlier, a few Sovereign Citizens, and of course, the people equating COVID-19 in general to Nazi Germany or some New World Order. When they start blaming George Soros or the Rothschilds, you’ll know you’ve hit some prime tinfoil hat conspiracy content.

              This isn’t to say detractors don’t have valid points. They often cite skyrocketing rates of depression and domestic violence as reason enough to end the lockdown. I’d have to agree. To me, quarantine always felt like a best option out of a pile of terrible options. Unfortunately, my only counter to these arguments is that these problems have always existed in our community, and it shouldn’t have taken a global pandemic for us to acknowledge them.

              There are a million other things coronavirus-related that need to be discussed, but they’re far beyond the scope of this particular post. I could go on all day about how remote schooling for children is the best idea, but that idea has to be squared with the fact that poor kids will be adversely affected, just as they are in every other terrible situation. I could also talk about how the initial lockdown made the virus worse for low income minorities because they are more likely to live in larger groups and in substandard conditions, which itself points to more egregious and <em>systemic</em> social ills.
            </p>

            <p class="text-left">
              Ultimately, I still have hope. But these days, that sentiment is hollower than I want it to be. I thought everyone’s shared humanity would be reason enough to come together and address an existential issue with reason, but, as usual, my faith in humanity was misplaced.
