          <p>This résumé site was first started early 2020 and was supposed to serve as a semi-professional page showcasing my education, work history, and the various certs I’ve picked up along the way. There was also supposed to be a “blog” element, where I would just jot down rando things about my life as they pertain to my new life in the tech industry. Just one month into the project, COVID took the world by storm and completely changed the landscape of my work life. 
          </p>
          <p>Mid 2020 saw me and the rest of the country doing absolutely nothing but eating, gaming, and browsing Twitch. I enrolled in school in hopes that I could knock out a quick Bachelor’s degree, but that’s proven to be a bigger time-sink than learning how to make sourdough. Working from home has kept my life utterly predictable (in a good way) and there really hasn’t been too much incentive - or need, for that matter, to keep the “blog” going. 
          </p>
          <p>I’m not entirely sure what the future holds for this site, but the hazy picture I see in the distance looks like a cool, contemporary site, showcasing whatever skills I decide to show off. It will definitely be more than just a black-and-white static page. 
          </p>
          <p>So, stick around :)  
          </p>
