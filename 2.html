              I currently hold the CompTIA Security+ certification. It’s a general, beginner level cert that shows prospective employers that I have a strong understanding of the basics of cybersecurity. While this is a great starting point for security-minded networking folks, there is so much more to the Security field than what this one cert covers.
            </p>

            <p class="text-left">
              Since I work in the Public Sector, I’m beholden to the <a href="https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodm/857001m.pdf" target="_blank">DoD 8750.01-m</a> directive. It’s a big, scary, official-sounding name for what is essentially just a set of rules dictating who can have which job. There are tons of certs that satisfy these requirements at different levels, and Security+ is right at the bottom for the newbies.
            </p>

            <p class="text-left">
              This is why I’m now studying for the <a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications/cybersecurity-analyst" target="_blank">CompTIA CySA+</a> exam. It would be like ‘leveling myself up’ in the game of professional skills. So many more IA levels will be available to me once I have this cert next to my name. It’ll also be one step closer to the coveted <a href="https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP#" target="_blank">CISSP</a> certification. This one is the granddaddy of them all. In fact, it’s the only cert mentioned in the directive <em>by name</em>.
            </p>

            <p class="text-left">
              There is so much I have to teach myself before attempting this exam. I have to be an expert in core networking functionality and be able to spot problems a mile away. I also have to learn how to think like a cybercriminal. Proactively guarding against threats is the main way modern systems keep their heads above water.
            </p>

              Some of the tools I’m currently teaching myself to supplement my CySA+ training are:

              It’s slow-going, tedious, and sometimes a little annoying, but I can feel myself getting better. The promise of better days ahead, personally and professionally, really has my foot on the pedal.

              I tend to not take social media too seriously. As a result, my pages don’t really reflect some of my more interesting personal hobbies, such as filmmaking. I saw this as an opportunity to showcase some of my less technical, spur-of-the moment projects. These are pretty rare and will usually sit and age until I can spare a few minutes out of the day to edit.

              It’s not a masterpiece, or even really a “vlog”, but it includes everything I like about the filming process. Shooting it was fun, and even though I shouldn’t have been driving while using my phone like this, I think the “hand-held” look is great. I made sure to set my fps to 24 to give it a cinematic feel.
            </p>

            <p class="text-left">
              Editing was interesting because it forced me to turn the mundane task of going to Buc-ee’s for pecans into something quirky and entertaining. The quick edits captured the important action and the faux sepia overlay gave the clip a non-serious, dreamy attitude.
            </p>

            <p class="text-left">
              Overall, this is pretty indicative of what I like to produce on my free time, and even though they’re few and far between, they’re a fun creative outlet for someone with no actual creativity.

              This site stood up on its own two legs on October 18, 2019.</h5><br>

            <p class="text-left">
              This site —<em>my site</em>— is officially up and running. After years of half-hearted attempts, I've finally managed to produce something I'm proud of, and looks competent enough to present people as something that represents <strong>me</strong>.</p>

            <p class="text-left">
              For years I’ve struggled with how to approach creating a personal site for myself. The internet is rife with ads promoting the latest and greatest CMS software “guaranteed” to give you the professional look. I tried them all: WordPress, Squarespace, Blogger, Wix… the list goes on. None gave me what I really wanted, unless I paid a premium for basic HTML features.</p>

            <p class="text-left">
              I decided to just do things the hard way. I resolved to code my site from scratch. It’s actually “semi-scratch” because it’s standing on the shoulders of Bootstrap, but 90% of the HTML tags were typed with my own fingers.</p>

            <p class="text-left">
              I decided to use Bootstrap because I needed something to take care of the small cosmetic details that would have made my work tedious and possibly overwhelming. If it weren’t for this framework, I’d still be obsessing over how to construct my page columns. With the site’s skeleton set up and a no-frills aesthetic in mind, I started transposing my résumé onto the site. Of course, this just led to more obsessing over how the information was going to be formatted. When the dust settled, I had my name, a link to my résumé, and four nav links. Everything had placeholder ipsum lorem but was mobile-first and semantic (mostly).</p>

            <p class="text-left">
              Now that this thing has been up for a few days, I’ve just been concentrating on adding and organizing my social media links, and even got around to adding a contact page (an ordeal in and of itself).</p>

            <p class="text-left">
              I plan on treating this Home page as a mini blog dealing with mostly career-related technology topics. I’ll also post these Site Updates when some of the static information changes significantly enough to call attention to it.</p>

            </summary><br>

            <p class="text-left">
              &emsp;While there is no fully formed and comprehensive plan for this site, it should generally be considered my online resume. It's structured blog-style so that I can keep my ramblings and updates separate from the stuff that's designed to get me a job.</p>

          	<p class="text-left">
            	&emsp;A cursory inspection will show that this is an simple, static site. I'm currently thinking of how I can spruce up the joint, but I'm not incredibly creative, and I'm terrible at JavaScript, I don't think this thing will ever need a real "back-end" (unless I become popular and need a sign-in form for meet and greets), and I don't even have the kind of time it would take to make this into a modern site.
