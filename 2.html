          <h6 class="text-left post-start"><em><strong>CoV-2</strong></em><br>by Rudy Portillo<br>24/Jul/2020</h6></summary><br>

            <p class="text-left">
               It’s been three months since my last update, and to be honest, morale hasn’t improved. I ended my last post with a pseudo-hopeful platitude about being grateful despite all that was going on in the world; and while that hasn’t changed, I can’t ignore the bleakness of our future. In a mere 90 days, things went from bad to worse. A thick fog of misinformation has settled over everything and thinking critically about our situation is turning into a full-time job in and of itself. The most upsetting part of all this is that the most predictable thing has happened: People have turned on each other. Whether this is out of fear or ignorance, I don’t know. There now may not be a distinction between the two.
            </p>

            <p class="text-left">
              I guess the most obvious example to point out would be the sheer amount of conspiracy theories cropping up on social media. Some claims are simply rehashed versions of the old “blame the government” trope and are generally harmless. But others are so absurd and comical that you can’t help but think the ones pushing these ideas are in on the joke. My favorite theory in this category is the “5G causes COVID-19” claim. The mental gymnastics required to link cell towers to a novel virus are impressive to say the least. I like seeing weirdos post maps of 5G towers overlaid with coronavirus hotspot maps to present the similarity as rock-solid proof of their ideas. It’s even more fun to see their bubbles burst when other people point out that those maps also correlate to population density, which of course explains why the other two maps look almost the same. But people don’t like to be wrong, and the conversation inevitably devolves into a depressing tirade of insults.
            </p>

            <p class="text-left">
              Less amusing though, is the disagreement over face coverings. I still cannot believe that this concept became politicized. I can’t understand the mind of someone who would hear the logical advice of “cover your face so your spit doesn’t get everywhere” and think, <em>No, you can’t make me do that</em>. From what I can tell, there are as many reasons why people won’t mask up as there are anti-maskers themselves. The most annoying people are those who cite their Constitutional freedoms as a free pass for not having to use a mask. 1) The virus does not discriminate based on nationality. 2) The virus does not affect people differently based on their level of patriotism. 3) Your Constitutional rights essentially end where mine begin. WEARING A MASK KEEPS OTHERS SAFE! After doing some research, the consensus since May of this year is that: at worst, simple homemade masks only block a certain percentage of aerosols of a certain size or bigger. At best, they block spit droplets at a high enough rate that there are numerous examples of the virus <em>not</em> spreading even in non-socially distanced situations. I’ve included a quote from May regarding the effectiveness of face coverings.
            </p>

            <br><br>
            <blockquote  class="border-left border-dark border-6 text-left" cite="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00818">
              Mandating face mask use in public is associated with a decline in the daily COVID-19 growth rate by 0.9, 1.1, 1.4, 1.7, and 2.0 percentage-points in 1–5, 6–10, 11–15, 16–20, and 21+ days after signing, respectively. Estimates suggest as many as 230,000–450,000 COVID-19 cases possibly averted By May 22, 2020 by these mandates.<br>

            </blockquote>
            <br><br>

            <p class="text-left">
              It’s important to note that hindering the virus’ spread is a three-pronged approach involving masks, hand washing, and social distancing. But for whatever reason, face coverings became the flashpoint, which is why I highlighted their effectiveness.
            </p>

            <p class="text-left">
              The more sinister side of this mask denial is that some people are intellectually dishonest about the situation, and will downplay the severity of the virus, in general, to support their views. Personally, I find that morally reprehensible. They’ll claim mortality percentages prove that the whole thing is “overblown” and that everyone is going to “catch it eventually”. Because of their self-centeredness, they refuse to understand that even a small percentage of 300,000,000 people is a large number. And it’s a number that represents actual humans dying, and there’s an even larger number of them actively suffering.
            </p>

            <p class="text-left">
              At the very least, these anti-mask crusaders acknowledge the existence of the virus as a fact. Some people think even that notion is going too far and won’t accept that there’s anything to be concerned about in the first place. For me, this is where the conspiracy theories regain some of their lightheartedness, simply because I view these people as ‘unreachable’ by common sense or logic. A good time-waster is to search YouTube with the term “COVID Karen”. You’ll be served with results dealing with anti-maskers like the ones mentioned earlier, a few Sovereign Citizens, and of course, the people equating COVID-19 in general to Nazi Germany or some New World Order. When they start blaming George Soros or the Rothschilds, you’ll know you’ve hit some prime tinfoil hat conspiracy content.
            </p>

            <p class="text-left">
              This isn’t to say detractors don’t have valid points. They often cite skyrocketing rates of depression and domestic violence as reason enough to end the lockdown. I’d have to agree. To me, quarantine always felt like a best option out of a pile of terrible options. Unfortunately, my only counter to these arguments is that these problems have always existed in our community, and it shouldn’t have taken a global pandemic for us to acknowledge them.
            </p>

            <p class="text-left">
              There are a million other things coronavirus-related that need to be discussed, but they’re far beyond the scope of this particular post. I could go on all day about how remote schooling for children is the best idea, but that idea has to be squared with the fact that poor kids will be adversely affected, just as they are in every other terrible situation. I could also talk about how the initial lockdown made the virus worse for low income minorities because they are more likely to live in larger groups and in substandard conditions, which itself points to more egregious and <em>systemic</em> social ills.
            </p>

            <p class="text-left">
              Ultimately, I still have hope. But these days, that sentiment is hollower than I want it to be. I thought everyone’s shared humanity would be reason enough to come together and address an existential issue with reason, but, as usual, my faith in humanity was misplaced.

              I’d like to start this post by saying that my girlfriend, dog, and I are doing just fine. My dog and I have been making the most out of the quarantine and are really enjoying each other’s unlimited company (I think he’s in it mostly for the unlimited snacks). My girlfriend works at a local hospital, and while that definitely adds to the stress levels, I have trust in her ability as a healthcare provider.

              It’s been wild to watch this whole thing unfold. I’m 30 years old, and I’ve lived through my fair share of apocalypses, but this was especially intense. Every zombie movie/show/game I had ever watched/played seemed like it had come to life. Except, this is reality, and people are actually dying. And there’s absolutely no one having fun.

              The situation became substantive to me one day in early March when I went to the grocery store and everyone was speed walking down the aisles and there wasn’t a single piece of animal protein on the shelf. I remember thinking: <em>If one person starts to jog or run, this whole thing is gonna turn into a riot.</em>
            </p>
            <p class="text-left">
              Thank God that’s not really the atmosphere at grocery stores anymore, but now I have to deal with the facemasks making everything feel like a dystopian cyberpunk noir film.

            <p class="text-left">
              I started working from home in mid-March and there isn’t even discussion about when we might head back to the office. I settled into working from my dining table way easier than I thought I would. Just like everyone else, we’re struggling to find a <span class="bg-dark text-dark">#############</span>.

              This is not me complaining. I’m one of the lucky Americans who get to remain employed full-time <em>and</em> maintain quarantine. I just find it immensely interesting to see that Life truly does just go on.

              My girlfriend’s nursing school coursework has moved completely online, and she’s had to rely solely on my five-year-old MacBook Pro do get everything done. This wouldn’t be an issue for anyone else, as these machines are designed to work great for their lifetime, but I’m not a regular computer owner.
            </p>
            <p class="text-left">
              This computer was the first Unix-like machine I had ever owned that was capable of doing real-life computer things. In 2015, I used this thing to start a game streaming channel on Twitch complete with the ridiculous microphone wiring harness needed to record audio from an Xbox One. I installed several virtual microphones to screencap me playing Steam games. I changed the shell, installed Homebrew and dabbled in Jenkins from GitHub, and about a million other stupid things that I don’t know how to uninstall. It’s gotten to the point where I have to check the memory usage and start deleting emails off the Apple email client in an attempt to reclaim some storage space.
            </p>
            <p class="text-left">
              Years of random Python programs, hacking practice, VMs, and using this thing as a DLNA server have really taken their toll. When my girlfriend needed to take a proctored exam, the web-app she was instructed to use returned so many security errors that it wouldn’t even let her login to the system. Long-story short, don’t use <a href="https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/14067/soundflower" target="_blank">Soundflower</a>. It’s not that good and apparently, it’s a big security hole (If you’re wondering how to uninstall it, you have to delete the .kext file).

              The silver lining to all of this is that I’m actually saving money. I’ve funded my savings account, paid off a credit card, and boosted my credit score into the 700s. *virtual shrug*

            <p class="text-left">
              I don’t know when this is going to end. I don’t know when I’m going back to work in an office, and I still don’t know how I feel about working from home. The days have been flying by and its depressing sometimes, and great other times. Either way, I’m grateful that my situation has allowed me to be philosophically existential, when so many others have their actual existence on the line.

          </summary><br>

            <p class="text-left">
              The new year has brought in several new changes that have been unexpected, surprisingly convenient, and altogether annoying. Seeing as Time is a construct, I’ve just been considering these events “business as usual” in the nascent career of an IT pro.
            </p>

            <p class="text-left">
              Two days before the end of 2019, my company, Omnitec Solutions Inc., was purchased and fully incorporated into Gryphon Technologies. The gritty details of the acquisition aren’t actually relevant to my position as a Service Desk Analyst, but they have been keeping me busy with mundane HR tasks like re-learning timesheet submissions, and re-enrolling in benefits.
            </p>

            <p class="text-left">
              It’s also given me the opportunity to update a usually static area of my site– my Work History. I’ve made the decision to just update the name of the company and leave out any reference to the former entity. My résumé has also been updated, and the new version is reflected in the link at the top of all my site pages.
            </p>

            <p class="text-left">
              My site itself is also receiving a few upgrades:
              <ul class="text-left">
                <li>Update to Bootstrap 4.4.1</li>
                <li>Site traffic is now monitored by Google Analytics</li>
                <li>Repurposed Home page to showcase a single blog post</li>
                <li>Now using pagination to archive older posts</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p class="text-left">
              I’m also considering moving the maintenance of this site to a dedicated Raspberry Pi desktop in order to have more coding elbow room. It’s getting a little cumbersome running absolutely everything out of my five-year-old laptop.
            </p>

              I currently hold the CompTIA Security+ certification. It’s a general, beginner level cert that shows prospective employers that I have a strong understanding of the basics of cybersecurity. While this is a great starting point for security-minded networking folks, there is so much more to the Security field than what this one cert covers.
            </p>

            <p class="text-left">
              Since I work in the Public Sector, I’m beholden to the <a href="https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodm/857001m.pdf" target="_blank">DoD 8750.01-m</a> directive. It’s a big, scary, official-sounding name for what is essentially just a set of rules dictating who can have which job. There are tons of certs that satisfy these requirements at different levels, and Security+ is right at the bottom for the newbies.
            </p>

            <p class="text-left">
              This is why I’m now studying for the <a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications/cybersecurity-analyst" target="_blank">CompTIA CySA+</a> exam. It would be like ‘leveling myself up’ in the game of professional skills. So many more IA levels will be available to me once I have this cert next to my name. It’ll also be one step closer to the coveted <a href="https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP#" target="_blank">CISSP</a> certification. This one is the granddaddy of them all. In fact, it’s the only cert mentioned in the directive <em>by name</em>.
            </p>

            <p class="text-left">
              There is so much I have to teach myself before attempting this exam. I have to be an expert in core networking functionality and be able to spot problems a mile away. I also have to learn how to think like a cybercriminal. Proactively guarding against threats is the main way modern systems keep their heads above water.
