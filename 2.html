            Another day, another cert. Network+ is done and stacked onto my A+. I have now completed the CompTIA&trade; “trifecta” and am well on my way to being a real Network Boi. 
            </p>

            <p class="text-start ">
            From Day 1, this has been a wild year. From insurgencies, to state-wide freezes, to exploding vehicles (not really, but almost), all the way down to astronomical emergency medical bills; the past nine months have been filled with pedal-to-the-metal shenanigans. Somewhere between all the chaos, I managed to take three cert exams, and pass them all. 
            </p>

            <p class="text-start ">
            Speaking to my successes, I want to credit ‘mental fortitude’ or my ability to ‘steel my resolve’ in the face of Life’s challenges, but the real Secret Sauce is anything <em>but</em> those things. I’ve stumbled and rolled through every metaphorical obstacle course my ambitions subject me to. Every single finish line has seen me heave myself across the threshold, battered, dusty, and unkempt. And as I try to catch my breath, hunched over with hands on my knees, I look up, bleary-eyed at the terrain I’ve covered so far… and I gotta say, I’m pretty proud of myself.

            <p class="text-start ">
              Getting the A+ cert brings me two-thirds of the way to the CompTIA “trifecta”. It’s a bit of a cringe term, but at least industry folks know what I’m talking about when it stumbles out of my mouth during a Google Meet. I believe it’s CompTIA’s second-most “beginner” level cert, but my journey achieving it was absolutely harrowing… or at least <em>half</em> of it was. 
            </p>
  
            <p class="text-start">
              I’d never intended to earn the A+ cert as I didn’t see its applicability to the cybersecurity field. Apparently, it’s VERY applicable, and with the new prevalence of side-channel attacks, it’s a good thing to have a solid foundation in computer hardware. It was a foundation I was sure I already possessed and was extremely cocky going into the official course and exam. The borderline arrogance was justified when I blew through the course and absolutely slam dunked the Core 1 portion of the exam. Hundreds of hours spent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/LinusTechTips/featured" target="_blank" class="link-1">watching LTT computer building tutorials</a> had finally paid off. 
            </p>
  
            <p class="text-start">
              When Core 2 rolled around, I tried riding that wave of confidence as far as it would take me...which was not very far at all. The second part of the cert was all dense troubleshooting how-to guides, “computer safety” processes, and “professionalism” tips and tricks. I tried speedrunning it like I did the first section and all it produced was frustration and self-pity. I made the terrible decision to Hail Mary the exam and opted to take the at-home version. This was the most egregious mistake in a long line of epic blunders. 
            </p>
  
            <p class="text-start">
              I was doing some light reviewing before my scheduled exam and about one hour before I had to login to PearsonVue, my home network had a Hindenburg-level meltdown. I scrambled to find any trickle of internet connection I could find. I eventually had to hardwire my laptop directly to my modem, bypassing my switch and router. When I finally logged on to the exam site, I had 3 mins to go through their maze of an onboarding process. To add to the pile, I tried to authenticate using a temporary state ID via a picture taken with my phone. When I finally got that mess untangled and was set to begin, the proctor couldn’t access my webcam and made me redo the entire onboarding process. I began the exam one and a half hours after my scheduled appointment. 
            </p>
  
            <p class="text-start">
              I failed. 
            </p>
  
            <p class="text-start">
              After settling my ID issues with a random county north of my city, and scheduling a second exam, I crammed for 5 days straight and took the test at an official testing center. I passed by the skin of my teeth on the second go around. Six measly points over the minimum score. I’d never been so happy. 
            </p>
  
            <p class="text-start">
              I celebrated by <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/luckyfridge" target="_blank" class="link-1">streaming</a> an equally poor performance on Warzone. 
            </p>
  
            <p class="text-start">
              Now that the dust has settled, I’m certified and eligible to move on to my next semester. The next class is Network+ so hopefully I’ve learned my lesson on how NOT to study for CompTIA exams. I doubt it though. 
            </p>
  
            <p class="text-start">
              As far as my site goes, I’ve made several minor updates:
              <ul class="text-start">
                <li>Mild <span class="font-monospace">&lt;hr&gt;</span> formatting</li>
                <li>Updating the mailing address on my resume</li>
                <li>Adding a fourth page to house my posts as they age</li>
                <li>Upgrading the backend styling to <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/" target="_blank" class="link-1">Bootstrap 5</a></li>
                <li>And of course updating the <a href="certs" target="_blank" class="link-1">Certs</a> page</li>
                <li>I even updated the Copyright year in the footer of all the pages</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
  
            <p class="text-start">
              I plan on making at least one more post before I complain about the Network+ exam. It’ll most likely deal with life post-Covid and how it’s affected my job and nearly everything else about the world. I may even talk about the various apocalypses Texas has managed to survive in the first 6 months of the year. 
            </p>
  
            <p class="text-start">
              All things considered, life is looking good and I’m pretty optimistic in general. I’m even working on a non-professional site at <a href="https://www.luckyfridge.com" target="_blank" class="link-1">luckyfridge.com</a>. The plan is to have it be centered around my gaming and streaming hobbies. 
            </p>
  
            <p class="text-start">
              So stay tuned. Cool things coming.

            <p class="text-start">
              Trash jokes aside, I did get a ‘promotion’, and it’s nowhere near management level. I’ve eeked my way out of the barren Service Desk landscape and wandered into the lush garden that is Quality Assurance. That’s right my friends, I now get paid to tell engineers and programmers “no”, and It feels great. 
            </p>

            <p class="text-start">
              My superiority complex does take a hit when the defect turns out to be my testing methodology and not necessarily their bad coding, but for the time being, I can blame that on “being new”.  All in all, it’s still sort of a dream-come-true to be paid to tell people, “sorry, this is unacceptable”.

              While the department is nascent, there is a lot of ‘potential’ and other buzzword positivity stuff about our team. I enjoy working with everyone which, in any industry, is the absolute most you can ask for.

              There was a pay increase, which was to be expected; but only served to remind me of the brutal income crisis our country is facing. After seeing a 34% pay increase, my high spirits were immediately cratered when I realized my income is essentially table scraps when viewed through a macro lens. I was disgusted with myself for being grateful for a miniscule slice of the Injustice Pie.

            I am finally ITIL V4 certified. I also have no idea what that means. Well, I know what it means, but I don’t know what it <em><strong>means</strong></em>. The study content itself reiterated the fact that the ITIL framework can be applied to every single organization, in every single industry, at every single corporate level, and “create value” if implemented properly. Those are some lofty promises and common sense tells me that one-size-fits-all synergistic management solutions are ‘suspect’ to say the least. 
            </p>

            <p class="text-start">
            The ITIL framework consists of business concepts, that integrate with other business concepts, all wrapped up in a larger, more nebulous business concept. If that seems confusing, that’s because it is. So confusing in fact, that I failed my first attempt at the exam with a 40%. If it wasn’t for the tried-and-true <a href="https://diontraining.com/" target="_blank">Jason Dion</a> I would have never passed. 
            </p>

            <p class="text-start">
            That also points out that the coursework provided for the cert by WGU was completely useless. I was passing the ‘practice tests’ with 90s and even scored a 100 on my final practice before the official exam. I was so disheartened by the failure that I took a solid week off school to just play Warzone. With some feedback from other students on the WGU Cybersecurity Discord, I found myself dishing out $12 for Dion training that was guaranteed to get me a passing score. Turns out that 100% of the school’s coursework was only worth about 70% of the actual information I needed. 
            </p>

            <p class="text-start">
            After going through the convoluted remote exam process, I was issued my gleaming new certification that never expires. I was pretty excited to tell my employer that I had a second cert to show off, but when I told them it was the ITIL V4, they shrugged. It did nothing to elevate my standing in the eyes of the government, so it didn’t even qualify for a mention in the Slack #announcements channel.

              I officially began courses at Western Governors University on July 1, 2020. I am majoring in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance with an expected graduation date of December 2023.
            </p>

            <p class="text-start">
              When I first saw that expected date, my heart completely sank. I couldn’t understand how I’ve spent the last ten years in school in some form or another and only had one year worth of credits under my belt. I immediately ran through my transfer evaluation and did some quick napkin math… sure enough… I only transferred enough credits to be considered a sophomore.
            </p>

            <p class="text-start">
              I shot off a hasty, yet wordy email to my ‘program mentor’ inquiring as to why I was expected to attend, for a full three years, a school that purported to have ‘accelerated’ programs. Turns out I don’t read the fine print… or listen during orientation… or pay attention in general… because the posted graduation date is a worst-case-scenario deadline for completion. The date is calculated with the supposition that the student is progressing at a snail’s pace, which I am definitely not.

              The courses at WGU are structured such that, as soon as you finish one course, you can move immediately to the next one, given you’ve passed the course assessment. Each course has its own study schedule that’s recommended for a timely completion, but moving faster is not only common, but encouraged.
            </p>

            <p class="text-start">
              As it stands today, I’m about one month ahead of schedule. If everything goes to plan and my life doesn’t experience any seismic shifts, I should have the degree completed in about eighteen months. It’s all very exciting, as I consider this my THIRD attempt at a bachelor’s degree.
            </p>

            <p class="text-start">
              As more time passes, I’m starting to realize that I may be part of the extremely small percentage of people whose lives were actually enhanced by the pandemic. Without the lockdown, I wouldn’t be working from home, and I wouldn’t be able to create the time or environment here at home specifically for study.
            </p>

            <p class="text-start">
              I’m tempted to invoke Fate here, but for now I think I’ll chalk it up to being a “glass half full” kinda guy.
